- secondary sources: public/external data (eg: government, Google Trends, WHO etc.)

### 3. Clean the Data

- handle anomalies and missing data

### 4. Analyze the Data

# Notes

### 1. Concatenate values from 2 string columns:

`=A2&B2 `if A2='x' and B2='y', then this will produce "xy"

`=A2&"-"&B2`` `adds a hyphen (-) between the two cell values

- the quotation marks are necessary to put text characters between two values

### 2. Range = collection of cells
